This is the code accompanying my bachelor thesis, an attempt to incorporate a simple fracture algorithm into video games.

It uses Unity3D and hosts both a tool to create fracture scenarios and the fracture simulation according to James F. O'Brien, Jessica K. Hodgins, Graphical Modeling and Animation of
Brittle Fracture, ACM Inc. (1999) and James F. O'Brien, Adam W. Bargteil, Jessica K. Hodgins, Graphical Modeling and Animation of Ductile Fracture, ACM Inc. (2002).
